# Introduction
Image processing is a method to perform some operations on an image, in order to get an enhanced image or 
to extract some useful information from it. It is a type of signal processing in which input is an image
and output may be image or characteristics/features associated with that image. 

This repository consists of some of the digital image processing techniques carried out in the industry. Some 
of the results are visualized below-

## Livestock theft
In remote Indian villages, cattle or livestock theft, such as cattle lifting or raiding, is rampant. Villagers are vigilant during the day, but most robberies occur at night when the environment is poorly lit due to intermittent power outages. After receiving numerous complaints from villagers, the officials have installed few battery powered CCTV cameras spread across places. Even after observing those CCTV footage for a week, the blind officials denied possibility of any theft. Villagers argued, pleaded those official babus but it was all in-vein. Only when a ray of light attempts to pierce this darkness, the real investigation unfolds. So, the dejected illiterate villagers with ill-lit lantern and a dark CCTV image need an image enhancing algorithm.

## Shadow Removal
The inner margin of books is also referred to as a gutter. Scanning or photocopying the books, magazines or notebooks, casts shadows in the gutter as shown in the image below. The idea is to clean the gutter for the provided image.

## Colorizer
In extreme JPEG compression, Cb and Cr can be decimated by the factor of 4 or 8 i.e. their pixel area is 1 16 and 1 64 that of Y respectively. Thus one can consider, almost all color information is lost and estimating that back is almost the problem of image colorization from gray image (i.e. Y channel). For transmission over low bandwidth network, the colorful image flyingelephant.jpg is extremely decimated in both Cb and Cr channels, whereas original Y channel is preserved. Thus inputs available are Y channel and extremely decimated (very small size) Cb and Cr channels, from which the original colorful image is extracted.
